    tinman "Oh, Winona Wyder West, how I long for your love."

    tinman "Why is it that you ignore my letters, and that when you do read them you cry and throw them away?"

    scarecrow "Ah, it seems he is not the security system, but rather the INsecurity system."

    dorothy "Haha real funny, anyway he’s literally like stalking her right now, this is definitely illegal."

    scarecrow "Yea, but aren’t we kind of doing the same thing?"

    dorothy "Yeeess, but we aren’t stalking her, we're just gonna snoop through her house and maybe steal some of her stuff for evidence."

    scarecrow "That kinda sounds worse than stalking."
